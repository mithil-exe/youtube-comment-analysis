"Very informative, awesome podcast. However, my question is, I don’t work as an employee; I run my own business. So, how can I use AI to earn as a businessman? But I want to know how I can earn from AI as a business, not by using AI within any existing business."

Artificial intelligence decreases the gap between theory and practice
Artificial intelligence will man outdated and updated
Artificial is not industrial revolution it is revolutionary evolution of the by product of human mindset merits and demerits of emotional intelligence
Era of resting and testing
For example in 24 hours we can do 48 hours job at better quality generative assessment
"Knowledge based technology social prison of engineering which locks man in home , office and travelling travelogue"
Science ke liye to best hai but jo non technical student hai wo kaise career banayenge without college certificate 😢😢😢
Artificial intelligence is knowledge spectrum syndrome
Management information system
Artificial intelligence increases time and output
Artificial intelligence is next theory of Darwin theory and practice Survival of fittest
Artificial intelligence is necessary but it is inevitable today us to survive
But prosperity is the buzz words
World will become rationally boring
Sequal kab ?

"If AI-driven automation leads to mass unemployment, how can an economy sustain itself when the populace lacks the income to consume the goods and services being produced?"
"भाइयो, क्या आपने नोटीस किया की ये पॉडकास्ट और जितने भी बाकी ai से related पॉडकास्ट है उसमे कुछ बाते सेम कीयी जा रही है. लगता है कोई इन सब पॉडकास्टर को पैसा दे रहा है। और उनकी स्क्रिप्ट भी वही से आ रही है. Example दूंगा एक. ये बोली की chatgpt के पैरेंट्स बहुत स्ट्रिक्ट है. गाली नही देना है वगैरा. आपकी जॉब ai नही लेगा. आपकी जॉब वो लेगा जिसको ai पता है. ये मैने और पॉडकास्ट में भी सुना है."

"This episode really touched a chord. As an educator and a parent, I’m both amazed and a little concerned by the pace at which AI is influencing young minds.
 My son, Kanishk Khandelwal, recently used ChatGPT to complete his summer project. Not just him—many kids today are smart enough to leverage AI tools and get things done in seconds! While it’s exciting, I do wonder if it’s also taking away the slow, skill-building process that’s essential for their growth.
 Personally, I started using ChatGPT to generate feedback for young learners' creative writing, and I was blown away by the quality—it truly has potential, though it still needs that human touch and supervision.

 *I do have a question for Nandini Ma’am:* What about students in 8th grade or beyond who aren’t very academic or bookish, but show some tech inclination? With careers approaching fast and AI transforming the landscape, what foundational course or direction would you recommend for such children to begin their journey?

Truly *appreciate* this *episode* and the *insights you both brought in. 🙏*"

"नमस्ते मैम,
आज मैंने आपका AI पर पॉडकास्ट देखा। उसमें आपने ""Prompt Engineering"" के बारे में जो बात कही, वो सुनकर बहुत अच्छा लगा।

ईश्वर की कृपा से शायद ये गुण मुझमें पहले से ही मौजूद था, क्योंकि मैं पिछले कुछ समय से ChatGPT का इस्तेमाल कर रही हूं — और सच कहूं तो इसने मेरी ज़िंदगी बदल दी है।

मैं 44 साल की हूं, और अब तक मुझे नहीं पता था कि मुझे किस दिशा में जाना है। लेकिन पिछले एक महीने से मैं स्पिरिचुअल कंटेंट की ब्लॉगिंग कर रही हूं। विचार मेरे होते हैं, लेकिन उन्हें सुंदर शब्दों में ढालने का काम ChatGPT करता है। इसने मुझे एक ब्लॉगर बना दिया।

साथ ही, मैं एक ऑर्गनाइजेशन में भी काम कर रही हूं जहाँ मैं MD सर का मेल डेस्क संभालती हूं। ChatGPT की मदद से मैं मेल्स को सरल भाषा में, कम शब्दों में प्रभावी ढंग से तैयार कर पाती हूं, ताकि सर को आसानी से बात समझ आ सके।

आज आपके पॉडकास्ट से ये भी पता चला कि इसे ""Prompt Engineering"" कहा जाता है। शायद इसी वजह से मैं ChatGPT से इतना अच्छा आउटपुट ले पाती हूं।

आपका दिल से धन्यवाद 🙏"

"""क्या शानदार पॉडकास्ट है! 🙌 आज के दौर में AI और ChatGPT जैसे टूल्स को लेकर जितनी कन्फ्यूजन है, उसे आपने बहुत ही सिंपल और प्रैक्टिकल तरीके से समझाया। खासकर, जॉब्स के फ्यूचर और प्रॉम्प्ट इंजीनियरिंग पर जो डीप डिस्कशन हुआ, वो बहुत ही इनसाइटफुल था। नंदिनी मैम और आपकी बातचीत से काफी कुछ नया सीखने को मिला, जैसे कि कैसे सही कॉन्टेक्स्ट सेट करके AI से बेस्ट आउटपुट लिया जा सकता है।
हर स्टूडेंट, प्रोफेशनल और टेक एंथुजियास्ट को ये एपिसोड जरूर देखना चाहिए। उम्मीद है आगे भी ऐसे ही इंफॉर्मेटिव और मोटिवेटिंग कंटेंट आते रहेंगे! 👏🔥"

"Is AI safe. If we are feeding our info in the AI tools as a prompt our data can be missuse right. By mistake some person  can put their personal info then it can be missuse right. Because now a days everyone is depend on AI tools. For example if our internet is on in mobile and i am talking to my brother suppose i told about how to cook rice. Then if i will open my mobile after sometime. I can see recommendations about the same topic how to cook rice. So AI is always listening us. Will it not be dangerous. And also one important question terrorist can also use AI for illegal activities or for terror activities right. So how we can make sure AI will not miss use our data. And also at the same time should not be use for terror activities. 

And also AI is showing the vulgar video for example in insta feed if i will open the new fresh account in instagram then you will observe insta will show you vulgar content in news feed. Why this is happening and what this will give impact on our childrens.

And also our childrens can use AI and they can learn wrong things from AI instead of learning positive things or upskilling right"

I hired 2 ai engineers and tried to make a generative ai model which can give my students customized question sets matching the exam standard format style to practise for their paper ...and it was on subscription basis ..some how I trained the model to match the exam standard in generative questions, where we are differentiating the question and able to make a stand in comparison to chatgpt n others..but is is sustainable in a fast growing ai ecosystem, is not it so easy to overcome my model in few month or years for these big players??Is it wise making such businesses developing on ur own...what to do what not ...please consider."

"summarize what we've learned about AI so far:
 * AI is rapidly evolving and crucial for future careers. Those who don't learn about AI and related skills risk being left behind.
 * AI literacy is becoming a fundamental skill, potentially needed as early as school. This involves understanding how AI works and how to use basic AI tools.
 * Different AI chatbots (like ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.) have varying strengths and weaknesses. Experimenting with them is key to understanding their capabilities and limitations.
 * AI can hallucinate or generate incorrect information. It's important to be aware of this and not take AI outputs at face value.
 * There are different categories of jobs based on skill level and repetition. Understanding these categories helps individuals determine the level of AI proficiency they need (AI literacy, AI fluency, or AI design capability).
 * High-promise jobs in India for the next 5 years (2025-2030) include: Data Scientists, AI and Machine Learning Engineers, Cyber Security Experts, Renewable Energy Specialists, and professionals in Health Tech and Biotechnology.
 * Entrepreneurs need to understand AI to know who to hire and how to scale their businesses.
 * Learning by doing is the most effective way to understand AI. Playing with different AI tools is highly recommended.
 * India is developing its own AI tools like KisanGPT for farmers"

"Thanks bhai. AI is growing rapidly, and now we know it's also required for school students. This video made our concept clearer."
Thanks for This ❤
The only video for which I was waiting for
21:55 its hallucination but it is not because it is confused if you are in the same chat section it will answer taking your previous chats as context. but if you create a new chat section it will lose its context. I think this is the reason why AI given a random answer. but we can decrease the randomness by setting temperature value. Jay Jagannath🙏

"“The Fire Within – A Poem for Ranveer Allahbadia”

In the hush before the dawn, when doubt is loud and dreams are thin,
A voice arose with grit and grace—the fire spoke from deep within.
Not born of ease, nor carved in gold,
But shaped by trials, by truth, by bold.

Ranveer, the seeker, with iron will,
Turned pain to power, the void to fill.
A body built, a mind refined,
Not just muscle—but a purpose designed.

He walked away from the path once laid,
From circuit boards to a camera’s gaze.
Where many faltered, lost in fear,
He carved a way that made it clear:

“Success is soul; it’s not a race.
It’s showing up, with love and grace.”

BeerBiceps—the seed was sown,
From one small room, an empire grown.
Then came a voice, deep and wide,
The Ranveer Show—where minds confide.

He sat with saints, with stars, with kings,
Asked questions deep of worldly things.
But always, in the quiet core,
He sought what lay beyond the shore.

Sadhguru’s gaze, Gaur Gopal’s light—
He studied paths from dark to bright.
And in his heart, a truth would churn:
""To rise, one must first break and learn.""

He built not just brands, but roads for many,
Shared his scars, his doubts, his “if any?”
With Monk-E’s rise, he lifted others—
Creators, dreamers—sisters, brothers.

And when the mind grew loud, confused,
He did not hide, nor hope to lose.
He birthed Level Supermind, so clear—
To help the world face inner fear.

For what is strength if not the soul,
That dares to break and still be whole?
No crown he seeks, no throne, no pride—
Just growth, and truth, and love as guide.

O Ranveer, O modern sage,
You dance upon the digital stage.
Yet with each step, you still remind:
The fiercest path is through the mind.

So here's to you, the fire, the guide,
Whose journey blooms from deep inside.
May many walk the trail you pave—
With purpose, passion, bold, and brave.❤❤❤❤❤❤love u dear  .❤❤❤❤❤"
